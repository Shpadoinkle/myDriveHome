# myDriveHome
 
Play around React Native project when I lived at the beach. 

With an evening commute of 40-60 mins I thought it would be a good idea to create a basic app to keep an eye on the traffic.

Unfortunately my route only contained two cameras, and neither watched the particular traffic bottle necks I was hoping to see. 

To view this app, you will need to download the Expo app and search for my user name of Shpadoinkle.
